        The app is designed with optional audio queues as an extra feedback
        mechanism on a successful click, if this is undesirable use the mute
        option at the top in the options bar. If you are not sure about having
        sound on, test out the press to 'play pop while counting' button below
        (with the mute option off) and compare it to the 'count silently'
        botton. Both include a subtle colour change on click for feedback on a
        successful click.
