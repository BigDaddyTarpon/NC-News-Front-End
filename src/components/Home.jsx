        The app is designed with optional audio queues as an extra feedback
        mechanism on a successful click, if this is undesirable use the mute option at the top in the
        options bar. If you are not sure about having sound on, test out the press to 'play pop while
        counting' button below (with the mute option off) and compare it to the
        'count silently' botton. Both include a subtle colour change on click
        for feedback on a successful click.

// Simple to Mute, just use if condition to allow/prevent playback, but ...
// IF figure out how to set vol, can have 1.0, 0.5 or 0 (mute)
// {volume: 0.5} in JS is half volume
// You can controll the volume of your Audio object using the volume atrribute (0=no sound, 1=max volume).
// "So just set the range of your input to be between 0 and 1 and use a useffect to change the volume attribute whenever the input's value changes".
